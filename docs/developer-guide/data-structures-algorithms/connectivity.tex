\section{Connectivity}
The typical elemental decomposition of the spectral/hp element method requires a
global assembly process when considering multi-elemental problems. This global
assembly will ensure some level of connectivity between adjacent elements sucht
that there is some form of continuity across element boundaries in the global
solution. In this section, we will merely focus on the classical Galerkin
method, where global continuity is typically imposed by making the approximation
$C^0$ continuous.

\subsection{Connectivity in two dimensions}

As explained in \cite{KaSh05}, the global assembly process involves the
transformation from local degrees of freedom to global degrees of freedom
(DOF). This transformation is typically done by a mapping array which relates
the numbering of the local (= elemental) DOF's to the numbering of the global
DOF's. To understand how this transformation is set up in Nektar++ one should
understand the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Starting point}

   The starting point is the initial numbering of the elemental expansion modes.
   This corresponds to the order in which the different local expansion modes
   are listed in the coefficient array \texttt{m\_coeffs} of the elemental
   (local or standard) expansion. The specific order in which the different elemental
   expansion modes appear is motivated by the compatability with the
   sum-factorisation technique. This also implies that this ordering is fixed
   and should not be changed by the user. Hence, this unchangeable initial local
   numbering will serve as starting input for the connectivity.

\item \textbf{end point}

  Obviously, we are working towards the numbering of the global DOF's. This
  global ordering should:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item reflect the chosen continuity approach (standard $C^0$ Galerkin in our case) 
  \item (optionally) have some optimal ordering (where optimality can
   be defined in different ways, e.g. minimal bandwith)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

All intermittent steps from starting point to end point can basically be chosen
freely but they should allow for an efficient construction of the global
numbering system starting from the elemental ordering of the local degrees of
freedom. Currently, Nektar++ provides a number of tools and routines in the
different sublibraries which can be employed to set up the mapping from local to
global DOF's. These tools will be listed below, but first the connectivity
strategies for both modal and nodal expansions will be explained. Note that all
explanations below are focussed on quadrilateral elements. However, the general
idea equally holds for triangles.

\subsection{Connectivity strategies}

For a better understanding of the described strategies, one should first
understand how Nektar++ deals with the basic geometric concepts such as edges
and (2D) elements.

In Nektar++, a (2D) element is typically defined by a set of edges. In the input
.xml files, this should be done as (for a quadrilateral element):
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XMLStyle]
 <Q ID="i"> e0 e1 e2 e3</Q>
\end{lstlisting}
where \inltt{e0} to \inltt{e3} correspond to the mesh ID's of the different
edges.
It is important to know that in Nektar++, the convention is that these edges
should be ordered counterclokwise (Note that this order also corresponds to the
order in which the edges are passed to the constructors of the 2D geometries).
In addition, note that we will refer to edge \inltt{e0} as the edge with local
(elemental) edge ID equal to 0, to edge \inltt{e1} as local edge with ID 1, to
edge \inltt{e2} as local edge with ID equal 2 and to edge \inltt{e3} as local
edge with ID 3.
Furthermore, one should note that the local coordinate system is orientated such
that the first coordinate axis is aligned with edge 0 and 2 (local edge ID), and
the second coordinate axis is aligned with edge 1 and 3. The direction of these
coordinate axis is such that it points in counterclockwise direction for edges 0
and 1, and in clockwise direction for edge 2 and 3.

Another important feature in the connectivity strategy is the concept of edge
orientation. For a better understanding, consider the input format of an edge as
used in the input .xml files which contain the information about the mesh. An
edge is defined as:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XMLStyle]
 <E ID="i"> v0 v1 </E>
\end{lstlisting}
where \inltt{v0} and \inltt{v1} are the ID's of the two vertices that define
the edge (Note that these vertices are passed in the same order to the constructor
of the edge). Now, the orientation of an edge of a two-dimensional element (i.e.
quadrilateral or triangle) is defined as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Forward if the vertex with ID \inltt{v0} comes before the vertex with ID
\inltt{v1} when considering the vertices the vertices of the element in a
counterclockwise direction 
\item Backward otherwise.
\end{itemize}

This has the following implications:
\begin{itemize}
\item The common edge of two adjacent elements has always a forward orientation
for one of the elements it belongs to and a backward orientation for the other.
\item The orientation of an edge is only relevant when considering
two-dimensional elements. It is a property which is not only inherent to the edge itself, but
 depends on the element it belongs to. (This also means that a segment does not
 have an orientation)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Modal expansions}

We will follow the basic principles of the connectivity strategy as explained in
Section 4.2.1.1 of \cite{KaSh05} (such as the hierarchic ordering of the edge
modes). However, we do not follow the strategy described to negate the odd modes
of an intersecting edge of two adjacent elements if the local coordinate systems
have an opposite direction. The explained strategy involves checking the
direction of the local coordinate systems of the neighbouring elements. However,
for a simpler automatic procedure to identify which edges need to have odd mode
negated, we would like to have an approach which can be applied to the elements
individually, without information being coupled between neighbouring elements.
This can be accomplished in the following way. Note that this approach is based
on the earlier observation that the intersecting edge of two elements always has
opposite orientation. Proper connectivity can now be guaranteed if:
\begin{itemize}
\item forward oriented edges always have a counterclockwise local coordinate
axis 
\item backward oriented edges always have a clockwise local coordinate axis.
\end{itemize}

Both the local coordinate axis along an intersecting edge will then point in the
same direction. Obviously, these conditions will not be fulfilled by default.
But in order to do so, the direction of the local coordinate axis should be
reversed in following situations:
\begin{lstlisting}
 if ((LocalEdgeId == 0)||(LocalEdgeId == 1)) {
     if( EdgeOrientation == Backward ) {
         change orientation of local coordinate axis
     }
 }

 if ((LocalEdgeId == 2)||(LocalEdgeId == 3)) {
     if( EdgeOrientation == Forward ) {
         change orientation of local coordinate axis
     }
 }
\end{lstlisting}
This algorithm above is based on the earlier observation that the local
coordinate axis automatically point in counterclockwise direction for edges 0
and 1 and in clockwise direction for the other edges. As explained in \cite{KaSh05}
the change in local coordinate axis can actually be done by reversing the sigqn
of the odd modes. This is implemented by means of an additional sign vector.

\subsubsection{Nodal expansions}

For the nodal expansions, we will use the connectivity strategy as explained in
Section 4.2.1.1 of \cite{KaSh05}. However, we will clarify this strategy from a
Nektar++ point of view. As pointed out in \cite{KaSh05}, the nodal edge modes
can be identified with the physical location of the nodal points. In order to ensure
proper connectivity between elements the egde modes with the same nodal location
should be matched. This will be accomplished if both the sets of local edge
modes along the intersection edge of two elements are numbered in the same
direction. And as the intersecting edge of two elements always has opposite
direction, this can be guaranteed if:
\begin{itemize}
\item the local numbering of the edge modes is counterclockwise for forward
 oriented edges
\item the local numbering of the edge modes is clockwise for backward oriented
edges.
\end{itemize}

This will ensure that the numbering of the global DOF's on an edge is in the
same direction as the tow subsets of local DOF's on the intersecting edge.

\subsection{Implementation}
The main entity for the transformation from local DOF's to global DOF's (in 2D)
is the LocalToGlobalMap2D class. This class basically is the abstraction of the
mapping array map[e][i] as introduced in section 4.2.1 of \cite{KaSh05}. This
mapping array is contained in the class' main data member,
LocalToGlobalMap2D::m\_locToContMap. Let us recall what this mapping array 
\begin{lstlisting}
  map[e][i] = globalID
\end{lstlisting}
actually represents:
\begin{itemize}
\item e corresponds to the e th element
\item i corresponds to the i th expansion
mode within element e. This index i in this map array corresponds to the index of
 the coefficient array m\_coeffs.
\item globalID represents the ID of the corresponding global degree of freedom.
\end{itemize}

However, rather than this two-dimensional structure of the mapping array,
\texttt{LocalToGlobalMap2D::m\_locToContMap} stores the mapping array as a
one-dimensional array which is the concatenation of the different elemental
mapping arrays map[e]. This mapping array can then be used to assemble the
global system out of the local entries, or to do any other transformation
between local and global degrees of freedom (Note that other mapping arrays such
as the boundary mapping bmap[e][i] or the sign vector sign[e][i] which might be
required are also contained in the LocalToGlobalMap2D class).

For a better appreciation of the implementation of the connectivity in Nektar++,
it might be useful to consider how this mapping array is actually being
constructed (or filled). To understand this, first consider the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The initial local elemental numbering (referred to as starting point in
the beginning of this document) is not suitable to set up the mapping. In no way
 does it correspond to the local numbering required for a proper connectivity as
 elaborated in Section 4.2.1 of \cite{KaSh05}. Hence, this initial ordering
 asuch cannot be used to implement the connectivity strategies explained above. As a
 result, additional routines (see here), which account for some kind of
 reordering of the local numbering will be required in order to construct the
 mapping array properly.
\item Although the different edge modes can be thought of as to include both
the vertex mode, we will make a clear distinction between them in the
 implementation. In other words, the vertex modes will be treated separately
 from the other modes on an edge as they are conceptually different from an
 connectivity point of view. We will refer to these remaining modes as interior
 edge modes.
\end{itemize}

The fill-in of the mapping array can than be summarised by the following part of
(simplified) code:
\begin{lstlisting}
 for(e = 0; e < Number_Of_2D_Elements; e++) {
     for(i = 0; i < Number_Of_Vertices_Of_Element_e; i++) {
         offsetValue = ...
         map[e][GetVertexMap(i)] = offsetValue;
     }

     for(i = 0; i < Number_Of_Edges_Of_Element_e; i++) {
         localNumbering = GetEdgeInteriorMap(i); offsetValue = ...
         for(j = 0; j < Number_Of_InteriorEdgeModes_Of_Edge_i; j++) {
             map[e][localNumbering(j)] = offsetValue + j;
         }
     }
 }
\end{lstlisting}

In this document, we will not cover how the calculate the offsetValue which:
\begin{itemize}
\item for the vertices, corresponds to the global ID of the specific vertex
\item for the edges, corresponds to the starting value of the global numbering on the
 concerned edge
\end{itemize}

However, we would like to focus on the routines GetVertexMap() and
GetEdgeInteriorMap(), 2 functions which somehow reorder the initial local
numbering in order to be compatible with the connectivity strategy.

\subsubsection{GetVertexMap()}

Given the local vertex id (i.e. 0,1,2 or 3 for a quadrilateral element), it
returns the position of the corresponding vertex mode in the elemental
coefficient array StdRegions::StdExpansion::m\_coeffs. By using this function as
in the code above, it is ensured that the global ID of the vertex is entered in
the correct position in the mapping array.

\subsubsection{GetEdgeInteriorMap()}

Like the previous routine, this function is also defined for all two dimensional
expanions in the StdRegions::StdExpansion class tree. This is actually the most
important function to ensure proper connectivity between neigbouring elements.
It is a function which reorders the numbering of local DOF's according to the
connectivity strategy. As input this function takes:
\begin{itemize}
\item the local edge ID of the edge to be considered
\item the orientation of this edge.
\end{itemize}

As output, it returns the local ordering of the requested (interior) edge modes.
This is contained
 in an array of size N-2, where N is the number of expansion modes in the
 relevant direction. The entries in this array represent the position of the
 corresponding interior edge mode in the elemental coefficient array
 StdRegions::StdExpansion::m\_coeffs.

Rather than the actual values of the local numbering, it is the ordering of
local edge modes which is of importance for the connectivity. That is why it is
important how the different interior edge modes are sorted in the returned
array. This should be such that for both the elements which are connected by the
intersecting edge, the local (interior) edge modes are iterated in the same
order. This will guarantee a correct global numbering scheme when employing the
algorithm shown above. This proper connectivity can be ensured if the function
GetEdgeInteriorMap:

\begin{itemize}
\item for modal expansions: returns the edge interior modes in hierarchical
order (i.e. the lowest polynomial order mode first),
\item for nodal expansions: returns the edge interior modes in:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item counterclockwise order for forward oriented edges
    \item clockwise order for backward oriented edges.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
