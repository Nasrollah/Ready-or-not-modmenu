\chapter{Installation}

Nektar++ is available in both a source-code distribution and a number of
pre-compiled binary packages for a number of operating systems. We recommend
using the pre-compiled packages if you wish to use existing Nektar++ solvers for
simulation and do not need to perform additional code development.
